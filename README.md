Extracting Image Details Using Generative AI with Streamlit | Build an End To End Image-to-Text App with LLMs & Streamlit


In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to create an AI-powered web app that extracts detailed information from images using Large Language Models (LLMs) through Google Generative AI. Learn how to build a fully functional image-to-text converter using Python and Streamlit, allowing users to upload images, query specific details, and save the results in TXT or CSV formats. This step-by-step guide covers everything from integrating the LLM to generating detailed image descriptions, making it an ideal project for anyone interested in Generative AI and web app development.
