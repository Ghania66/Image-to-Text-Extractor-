# 🖼️ Extracting Image Details Using Generative AI with Streamlit  
### Build an End-to-End Image-to-Text App with LLMs & Streamlit

 This project demonstrate how to create an **AI-powered web app** that extracts **detailed information from images** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** through **Google Generative AI**.  

Users can upload images, query specific details, and export results in **TXT or CSV formats**.
